 * Fix for post grid being pushed down by the sticky table of contents.
 *
 * The .grid__wrapper contains floated elements (.grid__item). When a floated
 * element follows another floated element (the .sidebar__right ToC), it gets
 * pushed down until it clears the first float.
 *
 * By setting `overflow: auto`, we establish a new block formatting context
 * for the .grid__wrapper. This makes it contain its own floated children and
 * prevents them from being affected by the floated sidebar.
